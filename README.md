# Rainy Days

This was a school assignment built in multiple stages. Initially, I was supposed to learn about the design aspect, then write the page in HTML and CSS. In the next stage, I added JavaScript to enhance the functionality.

## Description

Rainy Days is a website that was developed in multiple stages as my studies progressed. The knowledge I gained from the design part would have led me to make significant changes to the design of this site, as well as how I wrote the HTML code and styled it with CSS. However, some minor adjustments were made when we were tasked with implementing JavaScript and retrieving images and information from an API. The site fetches information via the WordPress REST API, allowing me to manage the data retrieved for the page. It was an exciting assignment where I had the opportunity to experiment with various functions using both JavaScript and CSS!
